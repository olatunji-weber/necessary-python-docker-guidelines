# Python-Docker Guideline

So, I came up with a python script that can create a Docker Image and instantiate a Container from that Docker Image. Hope this helps you to understand the possibilities clearly.

The approach here is to illustrate possibilities of python-docker interactivity using Python script which uses the Docker SDK to interact with Docker, allowing you to perform various Docker-related actions such as checking the Docker version, building a Docker image, creating and managing a Docker container. Here's an explanation of each function and what it does:

1. check_docker_version(): This function checks the version of Docker installed on your system using the Docker SDK. It creates a Docker client, fetches the Docker version, and prints it to the console.

2. build_image(): This function builds a Docker image based on the contents of a directory ("files") and a Dockerfile. It uses the Docker SDK to create a Docker client, build the image, and then tags it with "hello-world-image." The image ID is printed to the console.

3. create_container(): This function creates a Docker container from the previously built image. It uses the Docker SDK to create a client, create a container named "hello-world-container" from the "hello-world-image," and specifies the command to run within the container, which is "python [app.py](http://app.py/)." The container is set to run in detached mode, and its ID is printed to the console.

4. start_container(): This function starts the Docker container that was previously created. It uses the Docker SDK to get the container by its name, "hello-world-container," and then starts it.
5. stop_container(): This function stops the running Docker container. It gets the container by its name, "hello-world-container," using the Docker SDK, and then stops it.

6. remove_container(): This function removes the Docker container. It gets the container by its name, "hello-world-container," using the Docker SDK, and then removes it.

In the ( if **name** == "**main**": ) block, these functions are executed in sequence, starting with checking the Docker version, building the image, creating and starting the container, and eventually stopping and removing the container. The script provides a simple example of Docker automation using Python and the Docker SDK, allowing you to manage Docker resources from within your Python script.
